# Rules for contributing:

You're not eligible to commit (i.e., add) to the master branch directly because we should keep it clean for production. So, to add your work you need to work in a separate branch **and ensure that no one is working on the same files as yours**.

Commands to run in order to add your work to this repository are:

- `git checkout BRANCH_NAME` 

`BRANCH_NAME` could be `adding-feature-x`

- `git add .` to add all of the files you changed or `git add FILE_NAME` where `FILE_NAME` is a single file you changed.
- `git commit -m "COMMIT_MESSAGE"` where `COMMIT_MESSAGE` could be `bug fix` for example.
- `git push` to push your work to your branch.

Then open this repository from your browser and move to your branch from the branch tab next to `New Pull Request`. 
After that you will see a button on the right named `Pull Request` click it and create the pull request.
